## 🧠 Simon Game

**Simon Game** is a web-based memory game inspired by the classic electronic game *Simon Says*. Test your memory by repeating an ever-growing sequence of colors. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through levels.

### 🚀 How It Works

* The game starts when the player presses any key.
* A random color from the four options (red, green, blue, purple) flashes on the screen.
* The player must click the color button that was shown.
* Each level adds one more color to the sequence.
* The player must repeat the full sequence in order to continue.
* If the player clicks the wrong color, the game ends and displays the score.

### 🎮 Features
